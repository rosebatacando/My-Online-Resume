        <h1>My Hobbies and Interests</h1>
        <p>During my free time, I often find myself engaged in activities that align with my interests, which have become my hobbies. These pastimes make my time more exciting and fulfilling.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <h3><b>Gardening</b></h3>
                <p> I have a deep affection for plants and flowers. I make sure to spend time every day tending to my garden. It serves as a way of destress from my busy schedule, and the sight of beautiful flowers and lush greenery brings me immerse happiness.</p>
            <h3><b>DIY (Do-It-Yourself</b></h3>
                <p>My creativity always sparked when I come across recycled items. My boundless imagination flows as  I as transform these materials into beautiful creations.</p>
            <h3><b>Volunteering</b></h3>
                <p>Every year, I visit government hospitals to identify ten hydrocephalus patients who will be the beneficiaries of our charitable golf tournament. I assess and profile these patients, and we provide assistance in the form of shunts and financial support. Knowing  that I can alleviate their suffering and extend their lives in  my own small way brings me happiness and contentment.</p>
            <h3><b>Designing</b></h3>
                <p>Whether itâ€™s in  my home or through my digital artwork, I love to explore my innate creativity. This interest of mine is both fun and exciting, and I eagerly anticipate the results of my work.</p>
            <h3><b>Cooking</b></h3>
                <p>While I may not consider myself a master chef, I enjoy spending time in the kitchen and experimenting with various recipes. It brings me contentment when my family appreciates the meals I prepare.</p>
